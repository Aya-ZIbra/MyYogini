Image Data
I have here three new poses.  I could not find good images of Urdhva Hastasana at the angles I wanted. 
I've chose Virabhradrasana 1,2, and 3

Warrior 1,2, and 3

Warrior 1
=============


This is the image of the guru BKS Iyengar

Points to check

	· Front knee is over the ankle / front leg bent 90 degrees
	· Back Leg is straight
	· Both arms straight
	· Shoulders over hips/ in line
	· Hands over shoulders/ in line
	· 

A good pose:


A bad pose:

Front leg NOT bent 90 degrees

Warrior 2
==========

Here is the guru BKS Iyengar

Points
	· Front leg bent 90 degrees - hip in line with knee, knee over angle
	· Back leg straight
	· Shoulders over hips
	· Hands in line with shoulders (so you can see there is a slight drop in his back arm - that is OK within the degree he is showing).

Good example



Bad example

	· Arms are not inline
	· Front let not bent at 90 degrees - hip not in line with front knee
	· Knee not over ankle

Warrior 3
===========
	
	The guru
	· Points
		○ Arms, shoulders, hips and foot in straight line
		○ Standing leg straight
		○ Hips over standing leg
Good example

	
	Bad example
	
	· Standing leg is bent
	· Not a straight line like a letter T - this is like a saggy drawbridge!

From the Human Pose Estimation Blog:


The values Aya obtain are x,y positions in space numbered 1-15 (I think…).  So if 2 and 5 had the same y coordinate
